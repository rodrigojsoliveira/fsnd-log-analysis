# Log Analysis
This reporting tool will print reports based on the data in a sample database.
It will answer three questions using SQL queries:

1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
1. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
1. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

## Python version
The code was tested on Python 2.7 and should also work on later versions.

## Dependencies
You will need **psycopg2** module to run the code. To install, please refer to
psycopg2's website at http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html#binary-install-from-pypi

## Running the code
Run file 'log_analysis.py'. It will take some time to retrieve the results, so be patient!
File 'sample_output.txt' contains the expected results after program completion.
